Troubled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi & Saatchi Co.</ENAMEX> has attracted offers for some of its advertising units, with potential suitors including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interpublic Group</ENAMEX>, but has rejected them, people familiar with the company said.
Industry executives said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interpublic</ENAMEX> approached <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> in August about buying its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell-Mithun-Esty</ENAMEX> unit, but was turned down by Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maurice Saatchi</ENAMEX>. More recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interpublic</ENAMEX> inquired about one of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX>'s smaller communications companies -- identified as the Rowland public relations firm by several industry executives -- but again was rebuffed, they said. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interpublic's</ENAMEX> chairman and chief executive officer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Philip Geier Jr.</ENAMEX>, made the pitches in visits to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saatchi</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, the executives said.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> spokesman declined to comment about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interpublic.</ENAMEX> But the spokesman confirmed that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> has received several inquiries from companies interested in acquiring its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell-Mithun</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rowland</ENAMEX> units. He added, ``We have no intention of selling either business.''
Interpublic declined comment.
The offers come as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> is struggling through the most troubled period in its 19-year history. Takeover speculation has been rife, its consulting business is on the block, and its largest shareholder, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southeastern Asset Management</ENAMEX>, has said it's been approached by third parties regarding a possible restructuring. Analysts have continually lowered their earnings estimates for the company, and their outlook, at least for the short term, is bleak.
In the midst of the current turmoil, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> is attempting to shore up its ad businesses. It named a new chief executive officer, former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">IMS International</ENAMEX> head <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Louis-Dreyfus</ENAMEX>. It rebuffed an offer by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Spielvogel</ENAMEX>, head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Backer Spielvogel Bates</ENAMEX> unit, to lead a management buy-out of all or part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX>. And last week, people close to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maurice Saatchi</ENAMEX> and his brother, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles</ENAMEX>, would lead a buy-out if a hostile bid emerged.
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX>'s troubles have only whipped up interest among outsiders interested in picking off pieces of its ad businesses. While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX>'s major agency networks -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Backer Spielvogel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising</ENAMEX> -- would be difficult for any ad firm to buy because of potential client conflicts, its smaller businesses are quite attractive.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell-Mithun-Esty</ENAMEX>, for example, has had big problems at its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> office, but offers strong offices in other areas of the country, including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Minneapolis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>. That would would make it appealing to a network such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interpublic</ENAMEX> that already has a healthy <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> presence. (While there would be some client conflicts, they wouldn't be nearly as onerous as with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX>'s other agencies.) <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell-Mithun</ENAMEX> also would be a sizable addition to an agency network: It has billings of about $850 million and blue-chip clients including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Mills</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jeep/Eagle</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Brands</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rowland</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, has expanded aggressively, and now ranks as the fifth-largest U.S. public relations firm, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Dwyer</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Directory of Public Relations Firms</ENAMEX>. It would be attractive to an agency such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interpublic</ENAMEX>, one of the few big agency groups without an affiliated public relations firm of its own. Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> units include ad agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mccaffrey & Mccall</ENAMEX>, which has the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mercedes</ENAMEX> account and which has been attempting to buy itself back; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Marlboro</ENAMEX>, a sports and event marketing firm.
Despite <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX>'s firm stand against selling its ad units, U.S. analysts believe the company may ultimately sell some of the smaller units. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis-Dreyfus</ENAMEX>, in a recent interview, said he might sell ``a marginal agency or office.'' Analysts believe he may ultimately dispose of some of the non-advertising businesses.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential</ENAMEX>'s Final Four
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Prudential Insurance Co. of America</ENAMEX> said it selected four agencies to pitch its $60 million to $70 million account.
In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Backer Spielvogel Bates</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Saatchi</ENAMEX> unit that has handled the account since 1970, the other agencies include <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lowe Marschalk</ENAMEX>, a unit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lowe Group</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grey Advertising</ENAMEX>; and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">WPP Group</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scali</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mccabe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sloves</ENAMEX> agency. All agencies are <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based.
A spokesman for the insurance and financial services firm, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newark</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, said it hopes to make a decision within three to four months.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jamaica Fires</ENAMEX> Back
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jamaica Tourist Board</ENAMEX>, in the wake of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young & Rubicam</ENAMEX>'s indictment on charges that it bribed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jamaican</ENAMEX> officials to win the account in 1981, released a scathing memo blaming the agency for the embarrassing incident.
The memo attempts to remove the tourist board as far as possible from the agency, which pleaded innocent to the charges. Among other things, the memo contends that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young & Rubicam</ENAMEX> gave false assurances that the investigation wouldn't uncover any information that would ``embarrass the government of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jamaica</ENAMEX> or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jamaica Tourist Board</ENAMEX>.'' It also contends that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Young & Rubicam</ENAMEX> never told the tourist board about its relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ad Ventures</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jamaican</ENAMEX> firm hired by the agency. The U.S. indictment charges Ad Ventures was a front used to funnel kickbacks to the then-minister of tourism.
The memo also chastises the agency for the timing of its announcement Thursday that it would no longer handle the $5 million to $6 million account. The agency declined comment, but said it will continue work until a new agency is chosen.
