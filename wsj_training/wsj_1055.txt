After being trampled in Tuesday's selling stampede, the Nasdaq over-the-counter market dusted itself off and moved on in moderate trading.
But while the Composite gained 1.19, to 462.89, many issues didn't participate in the advance. ``It was a mixed bag,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Bruno</ENAMEX>, who heads over-the-counter trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Painewebber</ENAMEX>. ``We played catch-up in some areas, and sold off in some others.''
Volume totaled 132.1 million shares, which is about average for the year. Of the 4,348 issues that changed hands, 1,074 advanced and 866 declined.
Big financial stocks carried the day. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nasdaq Financial Index</ENAMEX> rose 2.09, to 454.86. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq 100 Index of the big non-financial stocks basically stood still, easing 0.12, to 452.23.
Despite the Composite's advance, some trading officials are guardedly optimistic that the market is on the road to recovery. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lance Zipper</ENAMEX>, head of over-the-counter trading at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kidder Peabody</ENAMEX>, said it is difficult to make predictions based on yesterday's trading volume. The advance felt more like a technical bounce, he said.
``The market acted better, but it wasn't a tremendous comeback,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zipper</ENAMEX> observed. ``If we get a decent rally {today}, maybe the buyers will come back.''
If <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">E.E. ``Buzzy'' Geduld</ENAMEX> is right, a seatbelt may come in handy during the next few sessions. The president of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herzog</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heine</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geduld</ENAMEX> expects the market to be ``very choppy'' for a while. ``There's a lot of uncertainty out there, and it will cause a lot of swings,'' he said.
