<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Convex Computer Corp.</ENAMEX>, continuing its rapid growth while other computer companies falter, reported an 87% increase in third-quarter net income from a year earlier and a 50% increase in revenue.
Net was $3.1 million, or 16 cents a share, up from $1.6 million, or nine cents a share. Revenue was $41.2 million, up from $27.5 million.
For the nine months, net was $7.7 million, or 41 cents a share, up 97% from $3.9 million, or 22 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue was $111.9 million, up 50% from $74.8 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Convex</ENAMEX> makes supercomputers that sell for up to $2 million and has an installed base of more than 550 systems and 340 customers world-wide. During the third quarter, it said, it won several significant contracts, including a five-year contract with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX> valued at an estimated $8 million.
Earlier this month, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Convex</ENAMEX> made a bid to outflank other supercomputer competitors like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Digital Equipment Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> by adopting an open set of standards and introducing new hardware and software to link different systems. The new products allow customers to add Convex machines to established systems made by other manufacturers, which ``opens up a phenomenal market for us,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert J. Paluck</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Convex</ENAMEX>'s chairman, president and chief executive.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Convex</ENAMEX> also recently agreed to use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Posix</ENAMEX>, a standard for the computer language called UNIX. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Posix</ENAMEX> is one of three or four versions of UNIX, but it is increasingly required by the federal government as it tries to standardize its computer systems. Most other supercomputer manufacturers have yet to adopt the Posix standard, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paluck</ENAMEX> said, adding that they prefer to maintain proprietary systems that lock in customers.
``They want a lobster trap -- once you get in, you can't get out,'' he said. ``But the customer doesn't want that.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Convex</ENAMEX> closed in over-the-counter trading on Friday at $15.375 a share, down 12.5 cents.
