<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amoco Corp.</ENAMEX> said third-quarter net income plunged 39% to $336 million, or 65 cents a share, as gasoline refining and marketing profits lagged substantially behind last year's record level.
A charge of $80 million related to projected environmental costs in its refining and marketing operations further depressed results. A spokesman said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amoco</ENAMEX> completed an environmental analysis last quarter but that no single clean-up project was responsible.
In the 1988 third quarter, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>-based oil company earned $552 million, or $1.07 a share. Revenue in the latest quarter rose 12% to $6.6 billion from $5.91 billion. Aside from the special charge, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amoco</ENAMEX>'s results were in line with Wall Street estimates. The company's stock ended at $48.375, up 25 cents in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amoco</ENAMEX> is the first major oil company to report third-quarter results. Analysts expect others to show a similar pattern. Generally in the quarter, overproduction of gasoline and higher crude oil prices pressured profitability. The industry's chemical profits also declined because excess capacity has depressed prices. Gasoline margins may rebound this quarter, some industry officials say, but they believe chemical margins could worsen.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Petrofina Inc.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>-based integrated oil company, yesterday said its third-quarter earnings declined by more than half. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fina</ENAMEX> blamed lower chemical prices, reduced gasoline margins and refinery maintenance shutdowns. It said net income dropped to $15.1 million, or 98 cents a share, from $35.2 million, or $2.66 a share. Sales rose 2.2% to $711.9 million from $696.1 million.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amoco</ENAMEX>'s refining and marketing profit in the quarter fell to $134 million from $319 million. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Chemical</ENAMEX> earnings declined by one-third to $120 million last year's robust levels.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amoco</ENAMEX>'s domestic oil and natural gas operations recorded a profit of $104 million in the quarter compared with a loss of $5 million, ``primarily on the strength of higher crude oil prices,'' said Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard M. Morrow</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amoco</ENAMEX> also sharply boosted natural-gas output, part of it from properties acquired from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tenneco Inc.</ENAMEX> last year.
But foreign exploration and production earnings fell sharply, to $12 million from $95 million. Higher oil prices weren't enough to offset a roughly $20 million charge related to a 10% reduction in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amoco</ENAMEX>'s Canadian work force as well as increased exploration expenses.
For the nine months, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amoco</ENAMEX> said that net income fell to $1.29 billion from $1.69 billion but if unusual items are excluded, operations produced essentially flat results. Revenue rose 12% to $19.93 billion from $17.73 billion.
