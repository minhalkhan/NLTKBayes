<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX>'s most famous raider says he isn't one. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Werner K. Rey</ENAMEX> believes fortunes are made by being friendly.
And in little more than a decade of being friendly -- and at the same time rocking the staid Swiss business community with some U.S.-style wheeling and dealing -- the 46-year-old Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> has grown from a modest banker to a billionaire. He achieved this in part with an uncanny talent for getting his foot peacefully in the door of established European companies.
His latest coup: September's masterminding of the five billion Swiss-franc ($3.07 billion) merger between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adia S.A.</ENAMEX>, the world's second-largest temporary employment agency, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inspectorate International S.A.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rey</ENAMEX>-controlled product-inspection company.
Shareholders must approve the merger at general meetings of the two companies in late November. But approval is almost certain since Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> and a friendly Adia management are in control.
After the transaction, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> estimates the value of his 20% stake in the new company, to be held by his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omni Holding AG</ENAMEX>, will be about 1 billion Swiss francs. This will be his return on an original investment of between 50 million Swiss francs and 80 million Swiss francs. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> bought a controlling stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Inspectorate</ENAMEX> for 18 million Swiss francs in 1982, building up the little-known engineering company with European and U.S. acquisitions.
``I like to succeed,'' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> during a recent morning of working at home, which he also likes. Home is an estate with green meadows opening onto Lake <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Geneva</ENAMEX> and a low-slung house whose rooms overlook the water and offer a view of the French Alps. In the corner of his reception room is a delicate antique desk piled high with dossiers. There is a small Renoir on the wall. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zurich</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">magazine</ENAMEX> Bilanz lists Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> as having a fortune of about 1.5 billion Swiss francs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Writes Bilanz</ENAMEX>: ``No one in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX> ever came so far so fast... He was simply the first in this country to realize that treasures were just lying around waiting to be picked up. In short: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> found companies with weak earnings but rich assets.''
However, the Swiss financial press in general, as well as many analysts, have had a hard time making up their minds about Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> and his un-Swiss ways.
For <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX>'s most prestigious newspaper, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neue Zuercher Zeitung</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> seems destined to remain the ``former Bally raider,'' an image that has proved hard to overcome.
In 1976, as an upstart in the eyes of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX>'s establishment, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> laid the foundations of his present-day prominence with an unheard-of raid on Bally, the country's traditional shoemaker.
Sitting beside a banker at a luncheon in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, where he was working as a financial consultant, he learned that a large packet of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bally's</ENAMEX> shares was up for sale. Looking into Bally, he could hardly believe what he saw: a company with enormous real-estate holdings in major European cities and a market capitalization of 28 million Swiss francs; it had 7,000 employees.
Investing four million Swiss francs earned from his financial transactions and two million Swiss francs from his parents and his wife, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> acquired 20% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bally's</ENAMEX> shares.
But such tactics were alien to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX> in 1976, and still aren't common because of share restrictions that companies are allowed to maintain. Eventually, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> was forced to sell his Bally shares to the weapons maker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oerlikon-Buehrle Holding AG</ENAMEX> as establishment pressure grew on this hostile move into the Swiss old boys' network.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> made 50 million Swiss francs on the sale. ``Bally was not an unfriendly takeover,'' he insists. Buying from willing shareholders makes an unfriendly takeover impossible, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> contends. ``I bought from willing shareholders.''
Nevertheless, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> has been very careful since then to make sure his moves are welcome. And he has worked to shed his raider image.
In 1979, his career as an industrialist began with the acquisition of the Swiss metals works Selve, based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thun</ENAMEX>. With the nonferrous metals business undermined in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX> by tough foreign competition and high domestic costs, this looked like a dull undertaking. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> brought about a merger in the next few years between the country's major producers; the increased efficiency has perked up the industry.
Three years later, machinery producer Ateliers <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">de Constructions Mecaniques</ENAMEX> de <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vevey S.A.</ENAMEX> was to become part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rey</ENAMEX> empire. Once again the company's future looked less than rosy. But after restructuring under new management, the profits began rolling in.
A major boost to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX>'s respectability among the Swiss came in 1986 when he sold 60% of his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Phibro Bank</ENAMEX> to the conservative Swiss cantonal banks. They renamed it Swiss Cantobank and are using it to expand abroad. In 1987, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> bested leading publishing houses to take over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Switzerland</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jean Frey AG</ENAMEX>, a major producer of magazines and newspapers.
And with the recent acquisition of 30% of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Winterthur</ENAMEX>-based machinery manufacturer <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gebrueder Sulzer AG</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> has enjoyed the status of white knight. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sulzer</ENAMEX> preferred him to financier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tito Tettamanti</ENAMEX>, whose secretive raid on the company's stock had led to a bitter battle.
Meanwhile, as such strategic investments have mounted, the merchant-banking arm of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omni Holding</ENAMEX> has been busily buying and selling dozens of companies, often after a financial or corporate restructuring.
Today, this branch of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX>'s empire runs under the name <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Omnicorp Offering Services</ENAMEX> and handles mergers and acquisitions, placement of securities and real estate. In its portfolio are such diverse companies as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United Kingdom</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Europe; Checkrobot Inc.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> company that makes supermarket checkout machines; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Norment Industries</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> manufacturer of securities systems; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Com Systems Inc.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> regional telephone company; and major real-estate projects in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>.
For financial analysts, reading <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omni</ENAMEX>'s accounts is a tough challenge. ``Companies move in and out,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helga Kern</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">KK Swiss Investment</ENAMEX>.
Financial analysts note that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> is attracted to companies that are undervalued on the basis of their real-estate interests. In August, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omni</ENAMEX> unexpectedly bought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inspectorate</ENAMEX>'s 80% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harpener AG</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>, a land-rich company. The internal transaction within the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rey</ENAMEX> empire puzzled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harpener</ENAMEX>'s small shareholders, but analysts say it makes sense for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inspectorate-Adia</ENAMEX> to focus on its main businesses of product inspection and temporary help.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rey</ENAMEX> says the move is yet another example of his conservatism. He explains that companies with real estate give ``security.'' The real estate can be used, he points out, as guarantees for bank loans for corporate development.
He says he wants to ``influence'' but not ``manage'' companies. ``I don't want to be like {financier <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan} Bond</ENAMEX> and the other Australians. I don't want companies to be built around me as a person. I want them to stand alone.
