U.S. health officials granted long-deferred access to the drug AZT for children with acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Sullivan</ENAMEX>, secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Health and Human Services</ENAMEX>, announced the move by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Food and Drug Administration</ENAMEX> after two years of restricted access for the youngest AIDS patients to the only anti-viral drug yet cleared to treat the fatal disease.
The drug was given treatment investigational new drug status, which is a label given to drugs that lack formal approval but are thought to be believed effective against a life-threatening disease. Under the designation, the drug's maker, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burroughs Wellcome Co.</ENAMEX>, will give the drug free of charge for a time to children with the disease and symptoms of advanced infection. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Burroughs Wellcome</ENAMEX> is a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wellcome PLC</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>.
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> action ``will give many sick children access to a drug that offers promise for improving or even extending their lives.''
Adults with AIDS have had access to AZT since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FDA</ENAMEX> approved the drug's usage for adults in March 1987. But despite nearly two years of research showing AZT can relieve symptoms in children, the drug still lacks federal approval for their use. As a result, many youngsters were unable to obtain the drug and, for the few exceptions, insurance carriers wouldn't cover its $6,400 annual cost.
AIDS has stricken 1,859 children under age 13, with many times that number believed to carry the infection without symptoms. To date, 1,013 of those children have died, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Centers for Disease Control</ENAMEX>.
