ARTICLE I, SECTION 7, CLAUSE 2: Every Bill which shall have passed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House of Representatives</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>, shall, before it becomes a Law, be presented to the President of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>; If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Objections</ENAMEX> at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>, it shall become a Law....
ARTICLE I, SECTION 7, CLAUSE 3: Every Order, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resolution</ENAMEX>, or Vote to which the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Concurrence</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Representatives</ENAMEX> may be necessary (except on a question of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Adjournment</ENAMEX>) shall be presented to the President of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>; and before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Representatives</ENAMEX>, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill.
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> told reporters a few months ago that he was looking for the right test case to see whether he already has the line-item veto. Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quayle</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Budget</ENAMEX> Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darman</ENAMEX> said recently they've joined the search. On Tuesday, the subject came up again when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marlin Fitzwater</ENAMEX> explained the constitutional argument based on the provisions above to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> press corps.
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> doesn't have any provision in mind, but line-item-veto bait will be like earthworms at midnight in the coming Continuing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Resolution.</ENAMEX> The harder question is whether anyone yet understands that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s fight for his constitutional prerogatives is about politics as much as it is about law.
We have been persuaded by the constitutional argument for the inherent line-item veto since 1987, when lawyer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Glazier</ENAMEX> first made the case on this page. The 1974 budget ``reform,'' passed over President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nixon</ENAMEX>'s veto, took away the presidential impoundment power, thereby introducing monstrous <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Crs</ENAMEX> and eviscerating the presidential veto.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glazier</ENAMEX> discovered that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Founders</ENAMEX> had worried that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> might take the President out of the loop. Article I, Section 7, Clause 3 says that whether it's called an ``order, resolution or vote'' or anything else, Presidents must have the chance to veto. Labeling an omnibus budget a ``bill'' can't deprive the President of his power to veto items.
Finding a test case shouldn't be hard, but there is something to be said for picking the best one possible. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> had the perfect case, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> blinked before it could go to court. After the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">HUD</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&L</ENAMEX> stories broke, some Congressmen began to worry that their influence peddling at executive-branch and independent agencies might some day get them in trouble. They worried about an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Interior Department</ENAMEX> directive to log all communications with Members or their staffs. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> inserted the following into the Interior appropriation: ``None of the funds available under this title may be used to prepare reports on contacts between employees of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dept</ENAMEX>. of the Interior and Members and committees of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and their staff.''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> warned that this would be an unconstitutional usurpation of its power. When it threatened to use this provision as the test for a line-item veto, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> caved. The fear <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has of any line-item-veto test led Members to add the single most contorted and ridiculous provision this year, ``This section shall be effective only on Oct. 1, 1989.'' This means Interior contacts can not be logged only on one day -- a Sunday that had already passed.
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> is looking for another unconstitutional bill, Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Dingell</ENAMEX> is trying again to raise the Fairness Doctrine from the dead. President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> vetoed this as a First Amendment violation. The ``Fairness'' Doctrine's enthusiasts are incumbents in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> who know the rules squelch lively discussions on broadcasts, deterring feisty challengers. There are also other provisions requiring Congressmen to join treaty-negotiating teams and new restrictions on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">OMB</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Unconstitutional</ENAMEX> bills make good legal targets, but the line-item veto is better understood as a political opportunity than as mere fodder for lawyers. Commenting on the budget mess this week, President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> said: ``The perception out there is that it's the fault of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>. And you can look to the leadership and ask them why that is the perception of the American people.'' Exactly right. Now's the time to make the political case that Presidents need the line-item weapon to restore discipline to the budget.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> is in no position to naysay Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> now that we're into Gramm-Rudman's sequestration. Just this week, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> conference met -- 231 conferees, divided into 26 different subconferences. Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Inouye</ENAMEX> agreed to close some bases in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX> in exchange for such goodies as $11 million for a parking lot at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Walter Reed Hospital</ENAMEX>. Conference negotiator Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Hefner</ENAMEX> pulled down $40 million in military bases for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Carolina</ENAMEX> and graciously allowed Senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Sasser</ENAMEX> $70 million for bases in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tennessee</ENAMEX>. President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> should take the Constitution in one hand and a budget ax in the other and get to work. He should chop out both unconstitutional provisions and budget pork. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> may have lost any sense of discipline, but that doesn't mean the country must learn to live forever with this mess. President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> has the power to change how <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> works, if only he will use it.
