The Berlin Wall still stands. But the man who built it has fallen.
East <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX> yesterday removed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erich Honecker</ENAMEX>, one of the staunchest holdouts against the reform rumbling through the Communist world, in an effort to win back the confidence of its increasingly rebellious citizens. But while it was a move that stunned the East bloc, it hardly ushers in an era of reform -- at least anytime soon.
For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politburo</ENAMEX> replaced Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX>, who had led <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> for 18 years and before that headed its security apparatus, with a man cut of the same cloth: Egon <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX>, the most recent internal-security chief and a longtime <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Honecker</ENAMEX> protege. East <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>, it is clear, is no <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Communist Party</ENAMEX> now shares power with the democratically elected Solidarity union. Nor is it a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX>, where yesterday the parliament approved constitutional changes meant to help turn the Communist nation into a multiparty democracy.
Still, any change in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> has enormous implications, for both <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX>. It raises the long-cherished hopes of many Germans for reunification -- a prospect that almost equally alarms political leaders in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX>, 52, was named the new party chief just minutes after the Party's 163-member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Committee</ENAMEX> convened in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Berlin</ENAMEX>. Although the East German news agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADN</ENAMEX> claimed Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> had asked to be relieved of his duties for ``health reasons,'' West German government sources said the 26-man <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Politburo</ENAMEX> had asked for his resignation at a separate meeting late Tuesday. (Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> was twice hospitalized this summer for a gall bladder ailment and his physical condition has been the subject of intense speculation in the Western media.)
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADN</ENAMEX> said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX>, a hard-line Stalinist who in 1961 supervised the construction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Berlin</ENAMEX> Wall, also was relieved of his title as head of state and his position as chief of the military. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> is expected to be formally named to all three positions once the nation's parliament convenes later this week.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX>'s ignoble fall culminates nearly two decades of iron-handed leadership during which Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX>, now 77 years old, built <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> into the most economically advanced nation in the Soviet bloc. His grip on power unraveled this summer as thousands of his countrymen, dissatisfied by the harshness of his rule, fled to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX>. Thousands more have taken to the streets in the last month in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX>'s largest wave of domestic unrest since a workers' uprising in 1953.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, the Bush administration took a characteristically cautious and skeptical view of the leadership change. The official line was to offer warmer ties to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX>, provided he is willing to institute reforms. But U.S. officials have strong doubts that he is a reformer.
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> told reporters: ``Whether that {the leadership change} reflects a change in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East-West</ENAMEX> relations, I don't think so. Because Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> has been very much in accord with the policies of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX>.'' One top U.S. expert on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> added: ``There is no clear-cut champion of reform, that we know of, in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East German</ENAMEX> leadership.''
Indeed, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> said on East German television last night that there will be no sharing of power with pro-democracy groups. He said, while dialogue is important, enough forums already exist ``in which different interests'' can express themselves.
The removal of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> was apparently the result of bitter infighting within the top ranks of the Communist party. According to West German government sources, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> and several senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politburo</ENAMEX> members fought over the last week to delay any decisions about a leadership change. But, with public demonstrations in the country growing in size and intensity, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> and several key allies lost out in this battle, officials say. Those allies included <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politburo</ENAMEX> members Guenter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mittag</ENAMEX>, who has long headed economic affairs, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joachim Hermann</ENAMEX>, chief of information policy. Both men were also relieved of their duties yesterday.
Although other resignations may follow, it's still not clear to what extent the change in party personnel will alter the government's resistance to fundamental change. Clearly, the central figure in this process is Egon <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX>. Born in 1937 in a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Baltic Sea</ENAMEX> town now part of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>, he was eight years old when World War II ended. Like West German Chancellor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmut Kohl</ENAMEX>, he represents the postwar generation that has grown up during <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>'s division.
Since joining the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politburo</ENAMEX> in 1983 as its youngest member, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> had acquired the nickname ``crown prince,'' a reference to the widely held view that he was the hand-picked successor to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX>. In fact, the two men have had strikingly similar career paths, both having served as chief of internal security before their rise to the top party position.
Moreover, both men have hewn to a similar hard-line philosophy. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Notably</ENAMEX>, one of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX>'s few official visits overseas came a few months ago, when he visited <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> after the massacre in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>. He later defended the Chinese government's response during a separate visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>. East German Protestantism in particular fears Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX>, in part because of an incident in January 1988 when he was believed to have ordered the arrest of hundreds of dissidents who had sought refuge in the Church.
However, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> also has a reputation for being politically savvy. His shrewd ability to read the shifting popular mood in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> is best illustrated by his apparent break with his old mentor, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX>. Indeed, according to West German government sources, he was one of the leaders in the power struggle that toppled Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX>. In recent days, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> has sought to project a kinder image. According to a report widely circulating in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Berlin</ENAMEX>, it was Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> who ordered police to stop using excessive force against demonstrators in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Leipzig</ENAMEX>.
``He doesn't want to have the image of the gun man,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Oldenburg</ENAMEX>, an expert at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bonn</ENAMEX>-sponsored  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Institute</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East European</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Studies</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cologne</ENAMEX>. ``He's not a reformer -- he wants to have the image of a reformer.''
As part of his image polishing, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> is expected to take modest steps toward reform to rebuild confidence among the people and reassert the party's authority. Besides sacking other senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politburo</ENAMEX> officials who allied themselves with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> could loosen controls on the news media, free up travel restrictions, and establish a dialogue with various dissident groups.
But will it be enough? West German government officials and Western analysts are doubtful. ``He doesn't signify what people want, so the unrest will go on,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oldenburg</ENAMEX> predicts.
At the same time, the expectations of the East German people are great and will continue to grow. Says one West German official: ``What's necessary now is the process of democratization. Not just that people are being heard but that their interests are being taken seriously.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chancellor Kohl</ENAMEX>, meanwhile, has invited Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> to open discussions with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bonn</ENAMEX> on a wide range of subjects. Reports in the West German press, citing sources in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX>, suggest Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> may serve only as a bridge between Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> and a genuine reform leader. Adding to that speculation is Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX>'s reputation as a heavy drinker, who is said to also suffer from diabetes. ``This is a dynamic process and we're experiencing the first step,'' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bonn</ENAMEX> official adds. The selection of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> may also disappoint <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>. Soviet leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> has pressed hard for a change in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX>'s rigid stance. Two reform-minded party leaders favored by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> as possible successors to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dresden</ENAMEX> party secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hans Modrow</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politburo</ENAMEX> member Guenter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schabowski</ENAMEX>, were passed over. If Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> sticks to rigid policies the pressure from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> could intensify.
In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> sent Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> a congratulatory telegram that appeared to urge the new leadership to heed growing calls for change. According to the Soviet news agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tass</ENAMEX>, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> expressed the conviction that the leadership of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Socialist Unity Party</ENAMEX> of {<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East} Germany</ENAMEX>, being sensitive to the demands of the time,... will find solutions to complicated problems the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GDR</ENAMEX> {German Democratic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX>} encountered.''
A force of younger pro-Gorbachev members in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East German</ENAMEX> bureaucracy has for some time been pushing for relaxation within their country. The older generation has been torn between a fear of tampering with the status quo and a fear of what might happen if they didn't.
From the perspective of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX>'s old guard, reforms that smack of capitalism and Western-style democracy could eliminate their country's reason for being. Unlike the other nations of the bloc, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> is a creature of the Cold War. Erasing the differences still dividing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, and the vast international reordering that implies, won't endanger the statehood of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> or a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX>. But it could ultimately lead to German reunification and the disappearance of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> from the map. Which is what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Old Guard</ENAMEX> fears. ``I'm sure they'll formulate a reform that will be a recipe for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GDR</ENAMEX>'s future as a separately identifiable state,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Simmons</ENAMEX>, a British journalist whose book on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX>, entitled ``The Unloved Country,'' was published this month.
Up to now, that recipe has consisted of a dogged effort by former leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Ulbricht</ENAMEX> to establish the country's international legitimacy, followed by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX>'s campaign to build the East bloc's only successful Stalinist economy into a consumer paradise. Neither man achieved perfection.
Early in 1987, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> and his team stopped paying thin compliments to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX> and joined with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Romania</ENAMEX> in rejecting any necessity for adjustments in their systems. The less-self-confident <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Czechoslovaks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bulgarians</ENAMEX>, in contrast, declared their intentions to reform, while doing nothing concrete about it.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East German</ENAMEX> media soon began presenting Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX>'s speeches only as sketchy summaries, and giving space to his opponents. By late 1988, they were banning Soviet publications.
The country abandoned its former devotion to socialist unity and took to insisting instead that each country in the bloc ought to travel its own road. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> spoke of ``generally valid objective laws of socialism'' and left no room for debate.
With this year's dislocations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>, and the drive to democracy in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East German</ENAMEX> leadership grew still more defensive. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politburo</ENAMEX> member <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joachim Herrman</ENAMEX> confessed to a ``grave concern'' over Hungarian democracy. ``Under the banner that proclaims the `renewal of socialism,''' he said, ``forces are at work that are striving to eliminate socialism.''
Some loyal voices, in and out of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East German</ENAMEX> Communist party, saw the nation's unrest coming. The first signs were economic. Despite heavily subsidized consumer industries, East Germans have for years watched the West pull farther out ahead. In 1988, for the first time, economic growth came to a dead stop.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gingerly</ENAMEX>, some economists began to blame central planning. Some writers in theoretical journals even raised the notion of introducing democracy, at least in the workplace. By summer, an independent reform movement was saying out loud what it had only whispered before.
But they are stalwart socialists. Their proclaimed purpose is to cleanse <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> of its Stalinist muck, not to merge with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West</ENAMEX>. One of their pastors has envisioned a ``new utopia'' of ``creative socialism.''
Meanwhile, the man Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> replaces has left an indelible mark on East German society. Imprisoned by the Nazis during World War II for his political beliefs, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> typified the postwar generation of committed Communist leaders in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> who took their cues from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>.
He was a ``socialist warrior'' who felt rankled by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>'s enormous postwar prosperity and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bonn</ENAMEX> government's steadfast refusal to recognize the legitimacy of his state. Finally, during his first and only state visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bonn</ENAMEX> two years ago, he won some measure of the recognition he had long sought. But ultimately he was undone by forces unleashed by his own comrade, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorbachev</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX>'s removal ``was bound to happen,'' says one aide to Chancellor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kohl</ENAMEX>. ``It was only a matter of time.''
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Community Commission</ENAMEX> increased its forecast for economic growth in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> in 1989 to 3.5%, slightly higher than its June projection of 3.25%.
In its annual economic report for 1989-1990, the commission also projected 1990 gross domestic product growth for the 12 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EC</ENAMEX> members at 3%. EC inflation was seen at 4.8% in 1989, higher than 1988's 3.6% price rise. However, inflation for 1990 was seen slowing to 4.5%.
Leading EC growth forecasts in 1989 was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ireland</ENAMEX>, seen growing 5% at constant prices. Slower growth countries included <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greece</ENAMEX>, at 2.5%, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX>, at 2.25%, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Denmark</ENAMEX>, at 1.75%.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Inflation</ENAMEX> is expected to be highest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greece</ENAMEX>, where it is projected at 14.25%, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Portugal</ENAMEX>, at 13%. At the other end of the spectrum, West German inflation was forecast at 3% in 1989 and 2.75% in 1990.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nestle Korea Ltd.</ENAMEX> opened a coffee and non-dairy-creamer plant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chongju</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX>. An official at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nestle Korea</ENAMEX>, a 50-50 joint venture between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nestle S.A.</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Doosan Group</ENAMEX>, said the new facility will manufacture all types of soluble, roasted and ground coffee, coffee mix and nondairy coffee creamer. The South Korean coffee market, consisting mostly of instant coffee, was estimated at about 100 billion won ($150.7 million) last year. Brands made by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kraft General Foods</ENAMEX> unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philip Morris Cos.</ENAMEX> had about 95% of the market share. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nestle</ENAMEX> currently has only about a 2% share with its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taster</ENAMEX>'s Choice coffee.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> plans to start negotiations soon on purchasing natural gas from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iran</ENAMEX>, the official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic Republic News Agency</ENAMEX> reported. The agency said Polish Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tadeusz Mazowiecki</ENAMEX> told Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahmoud Vaezi</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX>'s willingess to purchase the gas during Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vaezi</ENAMEX>'s current visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Warsaw</ENAMEX>. The agency didn't mention possible quantities and didn't say how the gas would be delivered.
A Chinese official harshly criticized plans to close a British naval base in downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> officials announced last week that the base will be relocated to a small island to allow downtown redevelopment. But <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> wants to use the base for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">People's Liberation Army</ENAMEX> after 1997, when the territory returns to Chinese sovereignty. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ke Zaishuo</ENAMEX>, head of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s delegation to a Chinese-British <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Liaison Committee</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX>, accused <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> of trying to impose a fait accompli and said, ``This is something we can not accept.''
The Israeli and Soviet national airlines have reached preliminary agreement for launching the first direct flights between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tel Aviv</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for the Israeli airline, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Al</ENAMEX>, said. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">El Al</ENAMEX> director Rafi <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Har-Lev</ENAMEX> and top officials of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aeroflot</ENAMEX> negotiated a preliminary pact in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> this week, the spokesman said. He added that concluding the deal requires approval by the governments of both countries, which have never had direct air links.
The chairman and a director of one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republic</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX>'s leading property companies, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">City Development Ltd.</ENAMEX>, or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDL</ENAMEX>, were charged yesterday with criminal breach of trust of some 800,000 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX> dollars (about US$409,000).
Kwek <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Png</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDL</ENAMEX>, and director Quek <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Leng Chye</ENAMEX> were arrested by the republic's Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau Tuesday night. In addition to abetting in the alleged criminal breach of trust, Kwek <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Png</ENAMEX> was also charged with dishonestly receiving S$500,000 that had been stolen. Both men were charged in a subordinate court and released on bail of S$1 million.
The charges are the culmination of weeks of rumors concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDL</ENAMEX> that have depressed the company's share price and to a lesser extent the shares of all companies owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDL</ENAMEX>'s controlling Quek family, brokers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX> say. The Queks control the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hong Leong Group</ENAMEX>, which has widespread interests in manufacturing, property and finance in both <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Malaysia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX>.
News of the arrest and charging of the two men helped to push prices on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX> Stock market sharply lower in early trading yesterday, but brokers said that the market and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CDL</ENAMEX> shares recovered once it became apparent the charges were limited to the two men personally.
One of the two British companies still making hard toilet paper stopped production of it. British Tissues decided to do away with its hard paper after a major customer, British Rail, switched to softer tissues for train bathrooms.... <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peasants</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Inner Mongolia</ENAMEX> have partly dismantled a 20-mile section of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s famed Great Wall, the official <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">People's Daily</ENAMEX> said. The paper said the bricks were used to build homes and furnaces and, as a result, the wall ``is in terrible shape.
