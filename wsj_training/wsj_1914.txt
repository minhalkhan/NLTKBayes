Democrat <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gene Taylor</ENAMEX> won a special election to fill the congressional seat vacated by the death of Republican <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larkin Smith</ENAMEX>, taking back the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX>'s lone redoubt in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> delegation.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX>'s overwhelming victory against Republican <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Anderson</ENAMEX> reclaims a seat the Republicans had held for 17 years and gives the Democrats their fifth victory in the seven special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House</ENAMEX> elections held this year. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX>, a 36-year-old state senator from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay St. Louis</ENAMEX>, won 65% of the vote in a district that has voted Republican in the past five presidential elections and that was once represented by Republican U.S. Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trent Lott</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX>'s victory was an embarrassment for both state and national Republicans. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anderson</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lott</ENAMEX> aide, received campaign assistance from the senator and from President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>, who visited the district last week.
Even so, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taylor</ENAMEX> carried all but one of the district's dozen counties. Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> died in a plane crash on Aug. 13.
