<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Breeden</ENAMEX> hadn't noticed that his new desk had just four telephone lines and one phone. It was, after all, only his second full day as chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX>.
But the lack of lines became painfully apparent. As the stock market lurched into a 190-point free fall on Oct. 13, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> found himself scurrying around the sixth floor of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> -- from his desk, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> was on an open line, to his assistant's office, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commodity Futures Trading Commission</ENAMEX> was connected, to a third room, where a computer monitored market moves. With other anxious calls pouring in, he recalls, ``I'd either have to disconnect the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> or go out to the secretary's desk.''
It won't happen again. Now there are more lines connected to the chairman's office, and the market-monitoring computer has been moved next to his desk. It's all part of a new ``command center.''
The changes in the office layout illustrate Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX>'s stance as the nation's top securities regulator. Like his predecessor, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Ruder</ENAMEX>, he was faced with a crisis in the stock markets soon after coming into office.
But unlike Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruder</ENAMEX>, who during the 1987 crash damaged himself by saying rather offhandedly that the markets might be closed, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> is turning the market drop to his own advantage, using it to further his agenda for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>.
In an interview and in congressional testimony, he repeatedly points to the recent 190-point plunge in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Dow Jones</ENAMEX> Industrial Average -- the second-largest ever -- as evidence of the need for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> to give the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> the ability to better monitor leveraged buy-out loan activity by brokerage firms and to track big trades in the market. A veteran of another financial crisis, the savings-and-loan bailout, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> wants to have the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> regulate securities issued by banks and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">S&Ls</ENAMEX>.
More broadly, he wants to ``modernize'' regulation by eliminating barriers between commercial and investment banking and by helping U.S. financial firms compete in the global market. He believes the tax code encourages the use of debt instead of stock and may fuel leveraged buy-outs, an area the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> doesn't regulate directly but one where it wields influence both on Wall Street and in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>.
Also unlike Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruder</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> appears to be in a position to get somewhere with his agenda. As a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> aide who worked closely with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, he is savvy in the ways of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>. What's more, the coming months likely will offer him the opportunity to obtain his own majority on the five-member commission, enabling him to avoid the dissension that frustrated his predecessor.
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX>, a 39-year-old securities lawyer, has skirted some of the heftier issues facing the financial markets. For instance, he hasn't stated a clear position on high-risk, high-yield junk bonds, an area of growing concern as turmoil in the junk market spills over into stocks. He may be waiting to see the results of several pending <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> studies of junk market liquidity and disclosure rules.
He also has kept a close wrap on the names of people under consideration for the crucial post of enforcement director at the commission, a job vacant since the summer. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX>'s selection will be scrutinized as an important signal about the strength of his commitment to continuing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>'s high-profile pursuit of insider trading and market manipulation on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> seems likely to let the new chairman have his way for a while. Members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Banking Committee</ENAMEX> know Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> from working on the thrift-bailout bill, and the relationship generally remains warm. Indeed, during Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX>'s confirmation hearing last month, senators asked him to introduce his children three separate times -- more often than they asked about his qualifications for the job.
These days, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> is winning praise in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> and on Wall Street for his behind-the-scenes role in monitoring the Friday-the-13th market plunge and the following Monday's harrowing morning session. As a regulator charged with restoring investor confidence, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> avoided making market-jarring comments and worked to gather information critical to Wall Street and to other government agencies.
Not everyone has jumped on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> bandwagon, however. Some in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> contend that it's too soon to tell whether Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> will help or hinder the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>. ``I don't think this was a real test,'' says one congressional aide. ``It was a fairly stressful weekend, but my sense is if you hadn't had <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Breeden</ENAMEX> there, it wouldn't have made much of a difference.''
For some at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX>, an agency that covets its independence, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> may be too much of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> insider. They note that he has adorned his office with five photos of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX>, one of them featuring the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Dog</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Millie</ENAMEX>. They worry that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> also will roll over when told to do so by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>. But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> already has shown an eagerness to run the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> his way. During the Monday market rebound, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> exchange spokesman told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cable News Network</ENAMEX> viewers that the industrial average had turned down 70 points. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stunned</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> turned to his market-monitoring computer, which by then was next to his desk. It showed the DJIA up 30 points.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> staffers soon determined that a widely watched stock-market service, Quotron, had miscalculated the industrial average. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> instructed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SEC</ENAMEX> staffers to inform the network that it was airing the wrong number. ``It was the plunge that didn't happen,'' he says.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX> also is trying to use a far more catastrophic event -- the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> earthquake -- to move another rule change past Congress. That disaster closed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>'s stock options-trading operation, forcing those options to be switched to other exchanges temporarily.
Though obscure to most investors, the question of whether to list options on more than one exchange has aroused much interest in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, mainly because regional exchanges fear the change could bankrupt them.
Congressmen raised the issue yesterday at a hearing. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Breeden</ENAMEX>, not missing a chance to press his agenda, cited the earthquake. That event, he contended, simply shows the ``vulnerability'' of having listings on only one exchange.
