<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotheby's Inc.</ENAMEX>, the world's biggest auction house, is taking a huge <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX>-style risk on the outcome of the sale of art from the estate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John T. Dorrance Jr.</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Campbell Soup Co.</ENAMEX> heir.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Financial Services</ENAMEX> division has guaranteed the Dorrance family that it will receive a minimum of $100 million for the collection, regardless of what the bids for the art works total, people close to the transaction say. The collection, which includes two early Picassos, a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">van Gogh</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Monet</ENAMEX>, other paintings, furniture and porcelains, went on sale last night in the first of six auctions.
What <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotheby</ENAMEX>'s is doing closely resembles an underwriting by an investment bank. A corporation that wants to sell stock or bonds goes to a Wall Street firm, which purchases the securities outright, accepting the financial risk of finding buyers. If the investment bank can sell the securities at a higher price than it paid the issuer, it makes a profit.
At the initial sale last night, for example -- the sale featuring the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Impressionists</ENAMEX> masters -- bids totaled $116 million. That was slightly above <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotheby</ENAMEX>'s presale estimate of $111 million. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Normally</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotheby</ENAMEX>'s would have earned 20% of the total in commissions. Instead, people familiar with the transaction said, the auction house opted to forgo that percentage in order to obtain the collection and in exchange for taking a bigger chunk of proceeds exceeding $100 million.
Art dealers say that while auction houses occasionally guarantee the seller of a highly desirable work of art a minimum price, a financial commitment of this size is unprecedented.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana D. Brooks</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotheby</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North America</ENAMEX> division, vehemently denies it offered the Dorrance heirs a money-back guarantee, calling such reports ``inaccurate.'' Buried in the glossy hardbound catalog for the sale, however, appears the statement, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotheby</ENAMEX>'s has an interest in the property in this catalog.''
Explains a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotheby</ENAMEX>'s spokeswoman, the statement ``means exactly what it says. We have some level of financial interest'' in the collection. ``We don't disclose specifics.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Mirabello</ENAMEX>, a lawyer for the Dorrance estate with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX> law firm of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morgan, Lewis & Bockius</ENAMEX>, declines to comment on the financial arrangements.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotheby</ENAMEX>'s made the $100 million guarantee to keep the Dorrance collection away from its archrival, auction house <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christie</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International PLC</ENAMEX>; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christie</ENAMEX>'s has handled smaller sales for the Dorrance family over the years.
When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christie</ENAMEX>'s officials asked why the firm wasn't picked to sell the Dorrance collection, representatives of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorrance</ENAMEX> family ``told us it was a question of financial considerations,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Findlay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christie</ENAMEX>'s head of impressionist and modern paintings.
Collectors who have made their money on Wall Street have become an increasingly important part of the art business and their money has helped fuel the art boom, but recently it appears <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotheby</ENAMEX>'s has been returning the compliment.
In November 1987, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotheby</ENAMEX>'s essentially offered a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wall Street</ENAMEX>-style ``bridge loan'' of about $27 million to Australian businessman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alan Bond</ENAMEX> to enable him to purchase <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vincent van Gogh</ENAMEX>'s ``Irises'' for $53.9 million. It was the highest bid in history for a work of art. But two weeks ago, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotheby</ENAMEX>'s said that it has the painting under lock and key because the loan had not been fully repaid.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotheby</ENAMEX>'s is offering such deals because it's an art sellers' market, at least where the best works are concerned, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph Lerner</ENAMEX>, an attorney and author of the book ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art Law.</ENAMEX>'' ``There seems to be a lot of art for sale, but there's more competition. The competition gives the seller the ability to cut a better deal,'' he says.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorrance</ENAMEX> family will still receive a substantial portion of the auction proceeds above $100 million, people familiar with the transaction said. But it's likely that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotheby</ENAMEX>'s will take a higher than usual commission, called an override, on the amount exceeding the guarantee.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotheby</ENAMEX>'s has been aggressively promoting the Dorrance sale. At a news conference last May announcing plans for the auction, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotheby</ENAMEX>'s estimated its value in excess of $100 million. More recently, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotheby</ENAMEX>'s has predicted the collection will fetch $140 million. That's the highest estimate for a single collection in auction history.
The decision to put the entire collection on the block stunned many, since Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorrance</ENAMEX> had served as chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philadelphia Museum</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Art</ENAMEX>, and it had been assumed many of the works would be donated to the institution.
At last night's sale, 13 of 44 works that sold were purchased by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aska International Gallery</ENAMEX>, the art-acquisition unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aichi Financial</ENAMEX>, a Japanese conglomerate that owns 7.5% of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christie</ENAMEX>'s.
Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sotheby</ENAMEX>'s guarantee is raising eyebrows in the art world. ``The consumer has to throw out the idea that the auction house is a disinterested middleman,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> art dealer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Tunick</ENAMEX>. While he adds that he has no problem with auction houses who sell works in which they have a financial interest, ``It ought not to be hidden in some small print.''
In such situations, he says, the house ``is going to put the best light on things.'' For example, an auction house's comments on the condition of a work of art that is up for sale should be looked at with ``very open eyes,'' he says.
``There's more and more of this cash-up-front going on at every level,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Miller</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Art Funding Corp.</ENAMEX>, an art lender. Dealers and auction houses ``know if they don't lay out a half a million for this, another one will; it's that competitive.''
In January, two small <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> galleries, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Coe Kerr Gallery</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beadleston Fine</ENAMEX> Arts, snatched a major art collection owned by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Askin</ENAMEX> family away from rival auction-house bidders with an up-front payment of about $25 million.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christie</ENAMEX>'s spokeswoman said that while the auction house sometimes waives its seller's commission to attract art works -- it still gets a commission from the buyer -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christie</ENAMEX>'s won't offer financial guarantees because ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Christie</ENAMEX>'s believes its primary role is as an auction house, and therefore as an agent {for buyer and seller}, not as a bank.
