<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnival Cruise Lines Inc.</ENAMEX>'s common stock was dragged down yesterday amid concerns that a bankruptcy filing by a Finnish shipbuilder would delay delivery of three big cruise ships.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>-based company's stock fell $1.75 yesterday to $20.75 a share in heavy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> composite trading. Early yesterday, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnival</ENAMEX> said in a company statement that it had been ``notified unofficially'' that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waertsilae Marine Industries</ENAMEX>, the Finnish shipyard that is building its three new cruise ships, planned to file for bankruptcy. Officials at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnival</ENAMEX> declined to comment.
``There is just a tremendous amount of uncertainty about what the effect, if any, of all this is,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John P. Uphoff</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Raymond James Associates Inc.</ENAMEX> ``I didn't even know that a company in a socialistic country could file for bankruptcy.''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnival</ENAMEX> said the ``Fantasy,'' the first of the three $200 million ships that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnival</ENAMEX> has on order, is scheduled to be delivered next month, just in time for the winter tourist season in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>. That ship, which would carry about 2,050 passengers, would expand the capacity of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnival</ENAMEX>'s existing 14-ship fleet by 24%. The second ship, which is half-completed, is scheduled to be delivered in fall 1990, and the third in fall 1991.
``There's a 99% chance that the Fantasy will be delivered close to schedule,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Caroline Levy</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> ``The others will probably be delivered as well, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnival</ENAMEX> will likely have to pay a higher price for them.'' She said the company could pay as much as 25% more for the ships.
If the ships aren't delivered, however, it will likely have an effect on the company's earnings as soon as the 1990 fiscal year, which begins Dec. 1. Analysts said those estimates -- which range from about $1.80 a share to $1.95 a share -- are based on Fantasy being in operation in 1990. If the ship fails to arrive, those per-share earnings estimates could be trimmed 15 cents or more.
Analysts weren't willing to speculate on how much money <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnival</ENAMEX> might lose through deposits. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Normally</ENAMEX>, a company pays a portion of the total cost of a ship as it reaches various stages of construction. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnival</ENAMEX>, for example, has already paid about $160 million of the total cost for Fantasy. Some analysts say this may give it the right to seize the ship if the situation warrants it.
According to reports from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Finland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Waertsilae Marine</ENAMEX>, 19%-owned by conglomerate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oy Waertsilae</ENAMEX>, filed for bankruptcy yesterday after the shipyard's contractors had started to demand bank guarantees. The shipyard disclosed in mid-August that it expected losses stemming from a series of unprofitable orders.
