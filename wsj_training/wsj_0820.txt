Democratic leaders have bottled up President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX>'s capital-gains tax cut in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> and may be able to prevent a vote on the issue indefinitely.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> Majority Leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Mitchell</ENAMEX> (D., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maine</ENAMEX>) said he intends to use <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> procedures to force advocates of the tax cut to come up with at least 60 votes before they can address the issue. And neither Democrats nor Republicans are predicting that the capital-gains forces can produce enough votes.
``The 60-vote requirement will be there and they don't have the 60 votes,'' Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitchell</ENAMEX> said. ``They don't have the votes to get it passed.''
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Packwood</ENAMEX> (R., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ore.</ENAMEX>), the leading Republican proponent of the tax cut, didn't disagree. ``I'm not sure what's going to happen,'' he said. Previously he had said he would be able to find the requisite 60 votes eventually.
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> has offered his capital-gains-cut package as an amendment to a bill, now pending in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>, that would authorize aid to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hungary</ENAMEX>. Democrats are holding up a vote on the amendment by threatening a filibuster, or extended debate. For a cloture vote to stop the filibuster, Republicans must muster at least 60 votes.
Yesterday, Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Packwood</ENAMEX> acknowledged, ``We don't have the votes for cloture today.''
The Republicans show no sign of relenting. GOP leaders continued to press for a vote on the amendment to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> aid measure. And they threatened to try to amend any other revenue bill in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> with the capital-gains provision.
``This is serious business; we're serious about a capital-gains reduction,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas</ENAMEX> Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Dole</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>'s Republican leader. ``The strategy is `Let's vote.' ``
The Republicans contend that they can garner a majority in the 100-member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> for a capital-gains tax cut. They accuse the Democrats of unfairly using <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> rules to erect a 60-vote hurdle. Democrats counter that the Republicans have often used the same rules to suit their own ends.
The two sides also traded accusations about the cost of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Packwood</ENAMEX> plan. Democrats asserted that the proposal, which also would create a new type of individual retirement account, was fraught with budget gimmickry that would lose billions of dollars in the long run. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republicans</ENAMEX> countered that long-range revenue estimates were unreliable.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Packwood</ENAMEX> proposal would reduce the tax depending on how long an asset was held. It also would create a new IRA that would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made for a wide variety of purposes, including retirement, medical expenses, first-home purchases and tuition.
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> spokesman said President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is ``generally supportive'' of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Packwood</ENAMEX> plan.
