In what could prove a major addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philippines</ENAMEX>' foreign-investment portfolio, a Taiwanese company signed a $180 million construction contract to build the centerpiece of a planned petrochemical complex.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USI Far East Corp.</ENAMEX>, a petrochemical company, initialed the agreement with an unidentified Japanese contractor to build a naphtha cracker, according to Alson <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX>, who heads the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philippine</ENAMEX> company set up to build and operate the complex. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Luzon Petrochemical Corp.</ENAMEX>, said the contract was signed Wednesday in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> with USI Far East officials. Contract details, however, haven't been made public. The complex is to be located in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Batangas</ENAMEX>, about 70 miles south of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manila</ENAMEX>.
USI <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far East</ENAMEX> will hold a 60% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Luzon Petrochemical</ENAMEX>, according to papers signed with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philippine</ENAMEX> government's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board of Investments</ENAMEX>.
The proposed petrochemical plant would use naphtha to manufacture the petrochemicals propylene and ethylene and their resin derivatives, polypropylene and polyethylene. These are the raw materials used in making plastics.
The contract signing represented a major step in the long-planned petrochemical project. At an estimated $360 million, the project would represent the single largest foreign investment in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philippines</ENAMEX> since President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Corazon Aquino</ENAMEX> took office in February 1986. It also is considered critical to the country's efforts to both attract other investment from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and raise heavy industry capabilities. The project has been in and out of the pipeline for more than a decade.
However, workers can't break ground until legal maneuvers to block the complex are resolved, moves which caused the signing to remain questionable up to the last moment. As previously reported, a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philippines' House</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Representatives</ENAMEX> has sued to stop the plant. The legislator, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Enrique Garcia</ENAMEX>, had actively backed the plant, but at the original site in his constituency northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manila</ENAMEX>. The country's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> dismissed the suit, but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garcia</ENAMEX> late last month filed for a reconsideration.
In addition, President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aquino</ENAMEX> has yet to sign into law a bill removing a stiff 48% tax on naphtha, the principal raw material to be used in the cracker.
However, at a news conference Thursday, Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aquino</ENAMEX> backed the project and said her government was attempting to soothe the feelings of residents at the original site, adjacent to the government's major petroleum refinery in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bataan</ENAMEX> province. ``We have tried our best to tell the people in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bataan</ENAMEX> that maybe this time it will not go to them, but certainly we will do our best to encourage other investors to go to their province,'' Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Aquino</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manila</ENAMEX>-based foreign correspondents.
The project appeared to be on the rocks earlier this month when the other major partner in the project, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China General Plastics Corp.</ENAMEX>, backed out. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China General Plastics</ENAMEX>, another Taiwanese petrochemical manufacturer, was to have a 40% stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Luzon Petrochemical</ENAMEX>.
However, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> said that USI <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far East</ENAMEX> is confident other investors will take up the slack. He said USI <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Far East</ENAMEX> has applied to both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Asian Development Bank</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World Bank</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Finance Corp.</ENAMEX> for financing that could include equity stakes.
