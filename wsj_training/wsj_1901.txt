South Korean President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roh Tae Woo</ENAMEX>, brushing aside suggestions that the won be revalued again, said the currency's current level against the dollar is ``appropriate.''
His comments, made in response to reporters' questions at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Press Club</ENAMEX> here, signaled that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seoul</ENAMEX> is resisting U.S. pressure for a further rise in the currency's value. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> wants a higher won to make <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX>'s exports more expensive and help trim <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seoul</ENAMEX>'s trade surplus. Many South Korean business people want a devaluation instead, arguing that the won's recent gains already have weakened the country's export performance.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roh</ENAMEX> also said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX> is taking steps that would free the won to respond to market forces. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seoul</ENAMEX> has pointed to its lack of a foreign exchange market as one reason the won's value remains heavily controlled.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roh</ENAMEX> said a U.S. demand for the removal of South Korean import quotas on beef will be resolved ``satisfactorily'' but gave no hint when that will happen. Speaking to a joint meeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> earlier, he said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX> can't move quickly on such agricultural trade issues ``without causing political and social trauma.
