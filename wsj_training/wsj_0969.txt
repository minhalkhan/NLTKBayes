Labor Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Dole</ENAMEX> named a mediator to help resolve the lengthy labor dispute between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Mine Workers</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pittston Co.</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">W.J. Usery Jr.</ENAMEX>, labor secretary during the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ford</ENAMEX> administration, was named to mediate talks to settle the six-month strike by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UMW</ENAMEX>.
Previous talks between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pittston</ENAMEX>, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greenwich</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, and the union have been sporadic and unsuccessful.
The union called the strike in April after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pittston</ENAMEX> refused to sign the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">UMW</ENAMEX>'s national labor pact. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pittston</ENAMEX> seeks changes in health and pension benefits, among other things. No schedule for formal talks was set, but meetings are expected to begin soon.
