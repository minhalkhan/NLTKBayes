Your Sept. 26 ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politics & Policy</ENAMEX>'' article about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Bennett</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Emergency Drug</ENAMEX> Plan for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> gives the impression that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> has not been nor is actively involved. This is not the case.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> is very supportive of and an active participant in Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennett</ENAMEX>'s initiative. It was agreed at the outset of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Washington Drug Initiative</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s role would be to continue targeting the major drug traffickers through our <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Drug Strategy</ENAMEX>. Through these investigations we do not focus on the street drug user, but rather we target and attack major drug-trafficking organizations that control a large segment of the drug market. The trial of Raful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edmond III</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> serves to highlight our efforts in this area and the results achieved through our excellent working relationship with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Drug Enforcement Administration</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metropolitan Police Department</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">MPD</ENAMEX>).
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s role is to complement the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX> initiative through not only these major trafficking investigations, but also by providing a full range of services through various task forces and our contacts with local police squads handling drug-related crimes. In fact, we have agents assigned full time to assist the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MPD</ENAMEX> in drug-related crimes such as homicide and other crimes of violence.
