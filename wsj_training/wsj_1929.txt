Egon <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX>, the man tapped yesterday to become <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX>'s new leader, faces the same task that has fallen to neighboring socialist colleagues: reforming a country in crisis. But unlike the other new leaders in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Bloc</ENAMEX>, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> will face an immediate threat to his nation's very existence: German reunification.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX>, age 52, is known as an old-guard ironfist, one likely to continue the method of running a country that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Berlin</ENAMEX> Wall made famous. Even if he were to change his stripes and become another <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milton Friedman</ENAMEX>, however, he would still stand a good chance of losing a country.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> almost certainly will be a younger version of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erich Honecker</ENAMEX>, his rigid predecessor as dictator. Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> has followed much the same career path as Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX>: Both spent years overseeing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Freie Deutsche Jugend</ENAMEX>, the youth group that is the communist regime's principal tool for stamping young Germans into socialist citizens. More recently, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> has been in charge of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East German</ENAMEX> security, and is the youngest member of the ruling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politburo</ENAMEX>.
Faced with another Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX>, so many despairing East Germans are likely to flee that the two German peoples will get their reunification, de facto, on West German ground. But if <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX>'s arthritic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politburo</ENAMEX> does loosen up enough to permit Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> to make serious efforts at reform, he will face a challenge just as fundamental. Abandoning socialism means abandoning the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East German state</ENAMEX>'s reason for existence, and with it the justification for its watchdogs and its Wall. In this scenario it's hard to imagine that a pale imitation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Republic</ENAMEX> could avoid being pulled into some kind of tie -- economic, federal or stronger -- with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>.
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> may need a bit of time to consolidate his empire, which would do a lot to promote Reunification Scenario One. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cartoonists</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> have already mocked the exodus by imagining an advertisement placed by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX>: ``Wanted: one people.'' The West German embassies in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prague</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Budapest</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Warsaw</ENAMEX> are continuing to find refugees at their gates.
Of course <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX>, true to its tradition, could tighten its borders yet further. Two of the last gestures of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Honecker</ENAMEX> regime were to close the border to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Czechoslovakia</ENAMEX> and install halogen lights in some spots along the frontier. But with world-wide opinion -- even, apparently in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX> -- against <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX>, the country would have to turn itself into an Albania to clamp down further on refugees.
There have been some reports that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Krenz</ENAMEX> is moving to ``soften'' his reputation, notably rumors that it was he who kept <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX>'s state police off protesters' backs at the country's dismal 40th anniversary celebrations earlier this month. But even if he effects a Hyde-to-Jekyll transformation, he will face a serious ideological crisis and Reunification Scenario Two.
The problem is one that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> shares with other half-states, such as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Korea</ENAMEX>, but one it must shoulder alone in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Bloc</ENAMEX>. When <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Poland</ENAMEX> moves to reform, it can at least lean on its past: However flawed and short-lived <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Pilsudski</ENAMEX>'s interwar republic, it was a nonsocialist democracy. Czech reformers can recall the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wilsonian</ENAMEX> ideals of the same period in their country. Even the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> has Peter the Great to rediscover, should it choose to. But <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> is merely ``the land of truly existing socialism.'' Beyond that, it has to compete with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX> for a claim to the German identity. Up to now, the main weapon of the ``worker and peasant state'' has been the ideology of socialism.
With talk today of a second economic miracle in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> no longer can content itself with being the economic star in a loser league. Without <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moscow</ENAMEX>'s military and party behind it, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> runs the risk of disintegrating. If it goes capitalist, and increases trade with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Germany</ENAMEX>, it will convert itself, willy-nilly, into an economic annex of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Republic</ENAMEX>. There's a certain cruel logic at work here: It's particularly appropriate -- and tragic -- that the land that produced <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karl Marx</ENAMEX> should prove socialism's failure in an experiment that uses its own people as controls.
There may be forces that would delay this scenario. Ideologues are the last to surrender, and Germans are an ideological people. The protesters who greeted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mikhail Gorbachev</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Berlin</ENAMEX>'s airport earlier this month weren't shouting ``Go U.S.A'' -- they were chanting ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gorby</ENAMEX>, Help Us.''
Ideologues on the other side of the border can also slow the process. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Helmut Kohl</ENAMEX>'s governing conservative coalition is proving admirably true to the West German constitution by making more than 500,000 people of German descent automatic citizens this year alone. But within the government and in the think tanks outside it, many West Germans maintain that they don't want immediate reunification. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Politically</ENAMEX>, this currently is wisdom -- particularly given a nervous neighboring <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>. But it would be ironic if <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>'s reunification, just like its division, eventually were the result of actions in centers of power other than <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bonn</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Berlin</ENAMEX>.
In a statement that was as close as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> gets to practicing ``glasnost'', <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Otto Reinhold</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East German</ENAMEX> party theorist, actually acknowledged the reunification dilemma. ``The main problem,'' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reinhold</ENAMEX> said in an East German radio interview monitored by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Radio Free Europe</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Munich</ENAMEX>, stems from the fact that ``the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GDR</ENAMEX> is different'' from other <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East European</ENAMEX> states. ``What kind of right to exist,'' he asked, ``would a capitalist German Democratic Republic have alongside a capitalist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Republic</ENAMEX>?'' That's a question <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Germany</ENAMEX> can't answer easily, no matter what its new leader does.
