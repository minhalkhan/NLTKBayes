<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Adolph Coors Co.</ENAMEX> said its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors Brewing Co.</ENAMEX> unit will test market a new line of bottled water in the West beginning early next year.
The move, which was expected, marks the first time since Prohibition that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX> has sold a non-alcoholic beverage, and marks the company's entry into a crowded, but fast-growing market that generated about $2.2 billion in sales last year.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX> is hoping to become one of the first companies to distribute bottled water nationwide. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perrier</ENAMEX>, sold by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Perrier Group of America</ENAMEX>, a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Source Perrier S.A.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Evian</ENAMEX>, sold by a U.S. unit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BSN</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>, are distributed to urban areas nationally, but are less available in rural communities. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX>, with its large beer-distribution network, could penetrate more markets.
The company said the water will be called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX> Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water and will come from the same mountain spring as water used in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coors</ENAMEX> beer. The company said it will sell the water plain and with lemon-lime and cherry flavors and will package it in 28-ounce bottles and 6.5 ounce bottles as part of six-packs.
The test markets, though not specified, will be in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">northern California</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado</ENAMEX>, some of the hottest bottled-water markets.
