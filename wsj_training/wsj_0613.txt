The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX> stock exchanges are bracing for a turbulent separation, following <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Malaysian</ENAMEX> Finance Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daim Zainuddin</ENAMEX>'s long-awaited announcement that the exchanges will sever ties.
On Friday, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Datuk Daim</ENAMEX> added spice to an otherwise unremarkable address on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Malaysia</ENAMEX>'s proposed budget for 1990 by ordering the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kuala Lumpur</ENAMEX> Stock Exchange ``to take appropriate action immediately'' to cut its links with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX>.
The delisting of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Malaysian</ENAMEX>-based companies from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Singapore</ENAMEX> exchange may not be a smooth process, analysts say. Though the split has long been expected, the exchanges aren't fully prepared to go their separate ways.
The finance minister's order wasn't sparked by a single event and doesn't indicate a souring in relations between the neighboring countries. Rather, the two closely linked exchanges have been drifting apart for some years, with a nearly five-year-old moratorium on new dual listings, separate and different listing requirements, differing trading and settlement guidelines and diverging national-policy aims.
